Language Used - Python with Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

Problem Statement:-# telecom_churn_analysis Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription. Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

Approach –  To extract the insights from the dataset we are doing EDA on the given dataset. 

EDA consists of three parts –  
Data Exploration – Where we analyze and explore the data and do-little changes in the dataset to make it ready for our analysis. 
Data Cleaning - In this step we do the cleaning of the data in the dataset like filling the null values and deleting the duplicates and unnecessary data. 
Data Visualization – In this section we have plotted several graphs and extracted more insights from our dataset which will help the developers in rolling out the app in the play store. 
Conclusion -  
Company’s churn rate is 14.49%.  


More churn is in area 415, so company needs to focus on that area.   

States NJ (New Jersey), TX(Texas) and MD(Maryland) has more churn rates and company should investigate these states to decrease the churn rate.  

We can Notice for Voice-Mail Feature when there are more than 20 voice-mail messages then certainly there is a churn indicating improving the voice-mail feature.  

For long call time company should offer some discounts and upgrade the network.  

Customers having more minutes spent on the network tend to leave the its subscription and it clearly indicates that there is defect in the pricing strategy of the company.  

We can see customers without international plan are likely to churn more.  

We can see from that the churn rate is more up to 4 customer service calls. So, company should resolve their issues within that number of customer care calls.
